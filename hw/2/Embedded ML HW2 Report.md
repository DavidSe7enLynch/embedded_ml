### Embedded ML HW2 Report

#### Question 1

- I chose D2, D4 as two input pins, and LED_BUILTIN as the output pin.
- The code is in xor Arduino project





#### Question 2

- I used the same pins as Q1
- The c++ code is in hello_world Arduino project
- The python code is in xor.py, where I also checked the accuracy
- One observation is that the .cc file and .tflite of quantized model are larger than the unquantized ones.
